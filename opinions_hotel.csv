The room seemed to be clean and the bed was comfortable. Good wi-fi.  The room was small. The reception was very slow. Buffet breakfast was OK, but dishes ordered from the menu were really disgrace! Bagel with salmon and fried egg was ordered. It was no bagel, but very ordinary bun. The egg was burned from the down and the upper side was completely raw. 5-year old child could make it better. To serve such dish is disrespect to the customer. No selection of tea. Hot water for tea was served in a small coffee cup.

" Great location, walking distance from pretty much everything and next to one of the coolest bars in Tel Aviv  The room was really tiny to accommodate 2 people.

The receptionist is not always at the reception.
 Room clean  Nothing," Location is excellent! Staff was attentive to all of our needs. We liked the ability to cook breakfast for ourselves every morning. The best bakery is two doors down!  The facilities are starting to show wear and things need to be replaced, especially in the bathrooms. Our room was noisy as it was facing Dizengoff Street. Also, need to offer decaf coffee packets.", Bed was good the lady receptionist was really nice  bath rusty on side and small room," Location is good, air-condition in the room was excellent. It is also very quiet hotel - I did not hear sounds of the street or neighbors while being in my room, which I really appreciate.  at the breakfast, many items in the menu were not available (every day).

Plenty of public transport. The room was renovated & clean.  I ordered a suite with kitchen. In the kitchen there was a kettle and cups with spoons nothing else. It is expected that when a kitchen is in the room there are minimum things such as knifes forks and sum plates.

Truly excellent five star service, Everything was very nice. Staff was super helpful  Nothing
 Very nicely situated by equidistant from town / beach; Accesibility & staff very friendly and accomodating to my needs  Air Conditioner was not functioning properly," This being my second time staying at 130 Rock Apartments, I truly enjoyed my time there and will definitely return.Location is just perfect if you want to be close to Dizengoff Square/-street and its vicinity including nearby Gordon and Hilton beach.The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. I personally like the set-up of the studio type room with its kitchenette and bathroom, but also the rooftop terrace to relax  -"," The location was terrific, easy access to the beach and shopping, a little hard to find from the train station.  The breakfast was quite tasty: eggs, salad bar, bread, cheese.  Mix and match worked best.  The rooms are small, the hotel is old, and a little musty.  But the staff responsiveness made up for it.  The lobby is small but comfortable."," The staff, the breakfast and the free coffee was great. The bed was comfy and overall the hotel was good value. A special mention for Omer, one of the hotel's hosts. She was wonderful. Extremely helpful and responsive. By far and away the hotel's best asset.  The road work on Ben Yahud. Not the hotel's fault but it's happening and it's unpleasant to look at and sometimes very noisy."," Breakfast was delicious we were able to order from different dishes. The room was clean with a luxurious bath.  The rooftop pool was smaller than we thought, also not clean very much, and there were annoying personnel and other drunk hosts. The pool should be opened from 10 am, however when we tried it before leaving at 10:15 it was still closed. We booked this hotel primary for the pool so we were a bit disappointed.", The hotel's commitment to a rich breakfast showcased their dedication to guest satisfaction," Everything was perfect.

Nothing.If I had to say I couldn't find hair dryer but not a big deal., A great combination of fashion and function," The best thing there is the rooftop with beautiful garden and bar with the most welcoming barman I've ever met 😁 and beer was good!Also the hotel staff is nice, the room and bed are comfortable and clean, and location is great, next to tramway line and Rothschild boulevardThank you, Abraham hostel!  Wouldn't say the breakfast is great, would like to have hot food (and also coffee from machine was cold) and be full ready to its begining in 7:30 for people who need to have it in the early morning fastAnd one little thing - would be nice to have a curtain at the bad to close it, because some people turned on the light in the middle of night (and its just more comfortable)", Rooms were very nice and comfortable and in a convenient place.  Nothing to add," Wonderful dorms across the beach . Spacious and quiet place  Makes sense for dorms, but not the most comfortable pillow"," Great hotel as usual. Even when it was fuller than usual, due to the security situation in Israel, staff and facilities were still great"," 5min walk to the beach. Free water, coffee blender machine, and biscuits. Microwave, fridge, and safety locker inside room. Staff very helpful.  Small reception area, less facilities"," 1. Big comfortable bed2. Its clean for a hostel (we stayed in a separate room with our own bathroom)3. Room was good size and had a fridge with a freezer on top drawer(very nice)4. Curtains were blackout to a good extend (except a little bit on the sides - but if you press it with something you can fix it)5. Looks like a room in a real hotel 6. Good location - in front of best beaches in Tel Aviv (2 min walk) - but Tel Aviv is small and everything is in 30-40 min walk, maybe all that noise wasn't worth it...  1. Very noisy - but if you carry earplugs or bottle of whiskey shouldn't be a big deal2. Lack of flexibility - They simply do not want to let you in before 3pm (standard check in time) - Our flight was really early and we arrived at 6am - we asked how much we need to pay to go in early - they said it is an extra day price and we were forced to go to POD hotel nearby to sleep for a couple of hours until 3PM."," Second time I use this hotel, first time during Corona lock down and second time during war time. Super service from staff and particularly the manager Mr Doron always happy to help with a smile and deliver solutions.

 The location and the staff were great.," Location is excellent! Close to beach, shopping, and sites. Lots of restaurants near by.Our room had a closet that we found very convenient. We also took advantage of cooking breakfast every morning and loved having a nice size refrigerator. Security front gate.  The place is starting to show its age. In the bathroom, there is rust around all the hinges and the tile floors are all scratched up. Towels and sheets are feeling rough. Musty smell when we come back each day. No air conditioning in the hall ways.", close to beach and a easy bus ride to my meeting  I lost my ID card. They took a photo of it when I got there.

No Shampoo, no master door to the sink area."," Tel Aviv is one of the most expensive cities in the world, so one has to set moderate expectations. Dream Beach Boutique Hotel is in a great location just one street away from the beach and short walking distance to the old town. Even Jaffa old town is walkable, being only 3km away. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, but a little small (as stated on the website). Breakfast is just a few steps away in a sister property. The manager Arthur and his staff were all friendly and very helpful."," An authentically Israeli encounter into the intricate paradox between democracy and Judaism in the dynamic Middle East region.  The rooms lack windows, and there's an overabundance of disposable plastic tools.

Soundproofing", Vibe.furnishing.welcome drink and free breakfast off menu.great beachfront location! fantastic value for money  Receptionist on duty omitted to tell me I could use rest room until check in.despite me asking.arrived early from airport and spent day on beach roasting in heat!!! A kitchen staff member saw me much later and approached me and told me I could use the rest room.this an hour before check-in .He was doing HER job.very disappointing.," - perfectly located in Allenby Street, near Shuk HaCarmel as well as close to the beaches. Lots of bars, cafés, restaurants and supermarkets.- never met such nice, helpful and understanding staff in my life! Doron was so lovely and flexible to adjust our booking over and over again during state of war.- the room and all utilities were very clean and comfortable- the café located on 1st floor serves delicious breakfast, snacks and drinks- it‘s absolutely good value for money  nothing to improve"," Great location and stuff!Attention to details such as lovely fancy breakfast,L'occitane shower products.We also received wine, fruits and chocolate for our anniversary and upgraded rooms:)  All good", Location near the beach.  Entrance," Great breakfast, super friendly staff, very close to the beach", They were very accomodating. They held our luggage for us after we had checked out while waiting to go to the airport., Everything was perfect," Location, staff, breakfast", Location and services  None," The location was fabulous.  Ten minute walk to the beach.  Close to many bakeries, restaurants and shops.  Carmel Market 15 minute walk.  Staff was nice.  They helped us book a tour. They offered red wine nightly which was nice and had a espresso machine along w water dispenser in the lobby.  Room felt a bit boxed in. AC worked a bit too well."
 Location Coffee machine Staff  No window Bad light Wardrobe too small Needs renovation in overall, The location was excellent. The decor and the rooftop patio were exceptional. It was very quiet despite its location in a very busy area of Tel Aviv.  The bed was hard and somewhat uncomfortable., Nice staffConfortableNear the beachGood breakfast  Not a good view from the room window, The hotel charged me with extra money and they didn’t return it back," NOTHING  AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS We chose this hotel as we wanted a quiet business hotel, away for the hustle and  bustle of Tel Aviv, When checking in we even spoke to the receptionists about why we chose this hotel and she assured us the hotel was quiet and empty. When trying to go to the swimming pool, I was stopped by someone at the door telling me there was a party on the roof and I could only get access with a paid wristband, I was shocked as a paying guest I couldn’t believe what I was being told this. I walked straight past her with her shouting at me in Hebrew. When I got outside I couldn’t believe what I saw. There was a party with about 200 people, by a tiny pool area. There was not 1 chair or bed available. People were standing everywhere, and there was a DJ playing music so loud, so we went straight to reception and asked to speak to a manager. I was informed that there was no manager and there would’nt be one for another 2 days as it was a festival. I left my details with reception and was told that a manager would contact me once they return. Now more than 1 week later and surprise surprise no one has contacted me. What was interesting is there is a sign by the pool saying maximum capacity was 100 people, and there was definitely double that so clearly no safety rules are adhered to at this hotel. Even in our room we could hear the music blaring from the roof. The rooms are absolutely tiny there wasn’t even space to open our suitcases. The air conditioning wasn’t working in our room on arrival I phoned and asked for someone to come and fix it but nobody came. I had to phone again.The breakfast offering is very small and meagre. There is zero customer service at this hotel, zero service recovery was offered. Do not waste your money at this hotel. You will be severely disappointed.", Efficient and quick check-in made us feel welcomed and ensured a smooth start to our stay," Convenient location to Tel Aviv central bus station.  Comfortable bed, clean room, clean ensuite.A great place to stay if you're looking for a basic bed and bathroom. Friendly, helpful staff, great location in a funky area of Tel Aviv, clean and modern, really comfy mattress. But don't expect anything too flash. No in-room tea and coffee, no hairdryer, no iron, no fridge, you get the picture.  No extras - no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  No fridge.  Nothing except the bed and bathroom."," Breakfast was amazing! Location very good, close to the beach.  The bathroom was poorly designed. Water (lots of it) coming out of the shower. There were rooms where water was coming out on the hallway when people were showering. We saw coachroaches.", the location and the apartment is clean  the apartment is small for 3 people. the pillow and bed is not too comfortable, The modernness of the building  The TV had no apps and didn’t appear to function fully. The staff were not super friendly., Guests staff and cleanliness  Good," Perfect location, small hotel, small rooms, but have the essential, and the prices are reasonable for Tel.Great jakuzzi no the terrace.", Cool interiorsClose to beach  Very rude and unhelpful staff at receptionIt was like we were bothering one girl to ask her questions about airport transport etc," Great location, comfortable room. Convenient furniture.  Cleanliness of fitness club, On Saturday there is no good coffee in the dining room."," The location is great, in close proximity to the beach and with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. The staff was friendly."," Great location, nice room, staff is kind and helpful. Breakfast is rather nice too but  Coffee was as bad as it gets. Someone has to show them the basics of espresso making and I'm saying this because they run a coffee shop too. Espresso shot with a total flow of 4 seconds. Every beverage, cappucino, latte, flat white was ruined. Also the bathroom is really really small"," Great location, nice staff and interior. Hotel rooms have a good size, are clean and well equipped.  -"," Judging by the room dimension and facilities, might not be a 4 star, considering 4 stars european hotels. But have everything needed. Judging by the staff, it is a 5 stars! I've never seen such an amazing, nice team, all of them working together to create an incredible experience for the guests. Starting with the guys at the reception, the ladies from the restaurant, the housekeeping team, they are all very nice, polite, and walking the extra mile to help and support the guest. And the breakfast is delicious!", Felt homie and cozy.  Relaxing!  Mmm maybe the fact that there was not hot water to drink tea at night., Location was excellent. Food was very good.  Bathrooms were very small. Roof terrace would have been a great bonus.," Great location, walking distance to a huge number of attractions. Super close to the beach and the boardwalk. The room was large and we even got bumped up. Overall very nice stay and a satisfying weekend for a decent price. Would return :)  Some noise from the street - nothing too crazy. Parking is a bit hard but there are some lots nearby.Pro tip: If you have a ""Mafteah Discount"", use the Opera house parking lot - as of now, it's free."," Everything was perfect. Design, atmosphere,  inner yard  cafeteria  for breakfast, food. Staff was very helpful, cleaning perfect. A  coffee  machine and a microwave in the room were pleasant surprise  :) Super white and clean bedspreads and towels, all those super  deliciously  smelling cream, soap,   conditioner  in the bathroom😍 I really enjoyed  my staying  in the hotel and will highly recommend it to all my friends"," Location is excellent  Location, breakfast and hotel services"," The staff was excellent, we were supposed to be there from Oct.6-9, but less than a day into our stay the attack happened. The staff kept us well informed, advised us on what to do, made sure everyone went to the bomb shelter, had water and stayed calmed. We were lucky to manage a ride to the land crossing into Jordan on Sunday morning and they even helped us cancel our stay at Prima King in Jerusalem and reimbursed us for the day we did not use at your hotel.I wish I had their names to thank personally for their professional handling of this horrific event and we pray we will be able to come back to this beautiful country in a near future. Praying for Israel.  The food, but we only had lounge food on the Saturday we could not get out of the hotel, so I understand they were operating on very stressed circumstances!"," 1. Good location2. 3 cafes that I could use my breakfast boucher, so nice cafes. Also I could use my boucher not only in the morning. (Some cafes allow to use it until 8pm or whole day)3. Friendly staffs  Nothing"
 Clean and attentive staff  Not elevator. I have to dragged my 2 luggage 2 floor up.," Fantastic location - close to beach, restaurants and everything else. Staff were fantastic and apartment was excellent  Nothing!!!!", Location and cleanliness, The nicest people I have met in a very very long time . So helpful and kind  Aircon made a noise but that was a minor overall," clean, good breakfast and very helpful and friendly staff  nothing", The hotel's modern furniture added a sleek and stylish touch to the overall ambiance of our stay," Room was really spacious, clean and comfortable. Breakfast voucher for the cafe opposite was a really nice touch, and allowed you to get a drink and a pastry or sandwich each morning. Great location a short walk to the beach, Jaffa and markets. Staff really lovely and so helpful.  Quite expensive for a simple double room but Tel Aviv accommodation in general is costly so it seemed proportionate.", The room was clean and I got great value for my money., The staff was very friendyand accommodating  The noise as there is a bar under the rooms that is constantly with loud musicAlso the rooms are a bit outdated and the couch has multiple stains. I must say the owner gave us sheets to cover the couch and was very nice and helpful," Ambience, staff, location  Nothing", Great location and bars  Could have better breakfast," Good location, close to the beach. Morning coffee free of charge in the reception area. Nice roof terrace with an illuminated hot tub, sitting and shower.  Rooms quite small but adequate. Using black sheets is not a good idea - mine had a big white stain on it. Also the bathroom arrangement was strange - a glass enclosure, with privacy screening, but a clear strap left for no reason. I was sharing with my long-term husband, so no probs, but wouldn’t like to share with my new boyfriend or fiancée!!! 😂🤣😂"," The rooms were nice, the rooftop was amazing and the staff was super friendly. I arrived on the day before the war erupted and staff did everything to keep us safe and in good spirits.  Nothing"," Loved everything , staff was so nice , swimming pool lovely , location is exactly in a shopping mall . Bed very comfy , room quiet .  Nothing"," - the location is good, about 7-8 minutes away from the beach on foot- the staff is very kind, always there to answer questions and to assist with whatever problems may arise- there is a waiting room where you can stay if you arrive earlier than your checkin time, and you can use the water cooler there to refill your water bottles- they also have free coffee and cookies at the reception, though we never tried those- next door there is a coffee shop with bagels, and a few minutes away a shakshuka restaurant, both a great option for breakfast or brunch  - although the hotel is located in a generally quiet location, there is construction going on all around the building. I acknowledge that this is outside of the hotel's control, nonetheless it contributed a great deal to us waking up early in the morning and being unable to sleep due to the large amount of noise. perhaps in a few months it will be better. other than this, I have nothing to complain about."," pleasant, sweet staff at the reception, they helped with everything! cool atmosphere and location refresh the room stock a little and the hotel will be top :)  renovation needed)", The room was comfortable and 'fun' themed.  The bathroom was sparkling clean and the beds very comfortable.A big shout out to Paolina & Sophie!," Location is very good. Very busy neighborhood but room was quiet enough.Staff is well trained and really made a big effort to be friendly, welcoming and helpful. This is not so common in Israel.The room size is on the small side by American standards but pretty much in accordance with European standards.The old shower curtains of previous years, which were terrible and caused bathroom flooding, have been replaced with glass panes. This is a big improvement.The elevators work well, are well maintained, and operate efficiently and very smoothly. (This may be a small detail but can be a source of aggravation at other hotels.)Room and bathroom amenities and thoughtful little attentions are nice and appreciated. In-room and in-lobby complimentary coffee and water availability add an appreciated welcoming touch and are a very handy element of comfort.Breakfast is great. It offers a varied, lavish and tasteful menu. Breakfast staff are keen on providing good service under sometimes busy circumstances.  Minpunten  This hotel is rather better maintained than the average in Israel (and many places in Europe too) but still a number of things are in need of renovation or replacement: eg doors often do not fit the door frames, old door frames are chipped, the balcony needs renovation.The breakfast room gets very cramped and busy at rush hour. This can cause stress to the staff and discomfort to the guests. This room is actually too small, especially since it also serves as reception and lobby.", The beach is just a 5min walk from the hotel. The hotel provides free beach towels and a bag.," The location as well as the availability and courtesy of the staff. In particular I would like to give a special mention for Mr. Sudani, who always made me feel at home."," The room is big, the bed is comfortable, clean and comfortable. There are tee-pot, tee and coffee. Bathroom is big, so is the shower.  Windows are not clean from the outside."," clean rooms, old meets new - in a good way. The place had a good vibe which we liked. Bathroom was clean, new, filled with everything we needed.  No elevator, so being on the second floor meant carrying luggage up and down. The AC took a bit of time to combat the heat and humidity. After a while it was very pleasant in the room despite the summer."," Near to the beach,clean room,free parking for the car,staff did an excellent job and very nice,free towels for beach and free clean towels every day in the room,free coffee all day with cookies.Maybe the furniture was a little bit outdated but it just make a nice vintage look to the place.  At this money you can't get probably any better,so no we did not have anything not to like, we like it and if we'll come back in this beautiful and interesting city we will stay here again"," Location, staff extremely polite, helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  Nothing. All good will stay at your hotel again. Hope you guys are staying safe and please look after yourselves."," Great location, helpful staff, room was clean overall. Good WiFi . The hotel offered complimentary wine daily but only red which I do not like, maybe expand with white also.  Tiny lobby and elevator. Room needs an update, tiny bathroom. Air conditioning was freezing when on."
